# Aseprite_Palette_Reducer
 Aseprite Plugin for Reducing the current color palette

# How to use
## Getting Started
- Open Aseprite and click File>Scripts and then open the folder.
- Click and drag the lua script into the folder and rescan the folder.
- The script should now be useable within Aseprite!

## Using the script
WARNING: SAVE A COPY OF YOUR WORK AS THE CHANGES MADE ARE NOT UNDOABLE CURRENTLY

- Run the script and click Add Color for each color in your palette (the calculation may take a while time if more than 10 colors or applied to a large image).
- Once the color palette to use is entered, click Apply.
- Wait for the calculation to finish, please be patient as the LAB version has additional calculations to convert RBG values.
- Once the calculation is finished, I recommend clicking the Palette Options button, then selecting New Palette From Sprite, setting the number of colors equal to your custom palette size.
- Enjoy!
