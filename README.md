# Aseprite_Palette_Reducer
 Aseprite Plugin for Reducing the current color palette

# How to use
## Getting Started
- Open Aseprite and click File>Scripts and then open the folder.
- Click and drag the 2 lua scripts into the folder and rescan the folder.
- Both scripts should now be useable within Aseprite

## Using the scripts
WARNING: SAVE A COPY OF YOUR WORK AS THE CHANGES MADE ARE NOT UNDOABLE CURRENTLY

- Run the script and click Add Color for each color in your palette (the calculation may take a very long time if more than 10 colors)
- Once the color palette to use is entered, click Apply
- Wait for the calculation to finish, please be patient as the LAB version has additional calculations to convert RBG values
- Enjoy!
